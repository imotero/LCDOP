    <h2>LCDOP HISTORY</h2></div>
        <hr/>
    <p>The organization of thae league was initiated by the Cooperative Development Authority through <b>Adm. Soc Anthony M. Del Rosario</b> as oversight chairman of the LGU-COOP-CDA partnership, in the close collaboration with the <b>Office of the Provincial Governor of Cavite</b>, with the <b>Hon. Governor Ayong Maliksi</b> togerther with <b>Mr. Nelson Alindogan</b> representing the cooperative sector.</p>
        <br/>
    <p>Said partnership was forged duaring the holding of the <b>1<sup>st</sup> Tripartite Conaference for Cooperative Development</b> held in Tagaytay International Converntion Center, Tagaytay City on November 26-28, 2003 with the Provincial Government of Cavite as host.</p>
        <br/>
    <p>The idea of organizing the league was approved on the said event. A technical group was created to prepare a study on the mechanics, nature and function of the organization.</p>
        <br/>
    <p>On November 24, 2005, during the holding of <b>2<sup>nd</sup> National Tripartite Conference</b> at Bohol Tropics Resort, Tagbilaran City, various LGUs endorsed the creation of the league and elected the national officers. <b>Dr. Emmanuel M. Santiguel</b>, PCDO-Cavite was elected <b>Chartered President</b>.</p>
